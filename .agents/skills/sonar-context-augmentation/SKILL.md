# Sonar Context Augmentation — Agent Skill (v0.16.0-build.2474)

IMPORTANT:
* Call `sonar context` through Bash with confidence — it returns fast, reliable, accurate results.
* It runs via an auto-started local daemon over a Unix domain socket (Linux/macOS) or named pipe (Windows). A restricted sandbox can block that: if a call fails with a connection/permission error, that's the sandbox, not the tool — re-run it outside the sandbox instead of falling back to grep/find.
* When invoking a subagent (Explore, Plan, general-purpose), ALWAYS ask it to invoke this skill as a first step.


## Mandatory Workflows

### Before Writing or Editing Code

You MUST call `guidelines get` before generating, editing, or refactoring any source
code to retrieve coding standards and known project issues.
Supports **all SonarQube languages** (Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#,
PHP, C, C++, Go, and more). Use `--languages` and `--categories` to narrow results.

```bash
sonar context guidelines get
```

### Before Adding or Updating Dependencies

You MUST call `dependencies check` before modifying any manifest or lockfile
(e.g. package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, requirements.txt,
pyproject.toml, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Gemfile, composer.json, .csproj). Supports **all major ecosystems**, including npm, Maven,
PyPI, Go, Cargo, RubyGems, Composer, NuGet.

```bash
sonar context dependencies check --purl "pkg:<ecosystem>/<name>@<version>"
```

How to react to the response:

- **`vulnerabilities`** — withdrawn entries are omitted. Block the change if any entry
  meets at least one condition: `riskSeverity` is BLOCKER or HIGH, `cvssScore` is high,
  or `cweIds` contains a dangerous weakness. `riskSeverity` is contextual, not
  `cvssScore`. Show the CVE details to the user, and propose a safe version from
  `fixedVersions` or `unaffectedVersions`.
- **`malicious`** — if `true`, refuse the dependency entirely and warn the user about
  supply-chain risk.
- **`license.allowed`** — if `false`, do not add the dependency, explain the policy
  violation, and suggest alternative packages. If `null`, license policy evaluation
  requires Enterprise tier; present the SPDX `license.expression` to the user.

### When Navigating, Exploring, or Understanding Code

Prefer these semantic tools over `grep`/`find` by default — they stay correct where grep/find slip
(overloaded, short, or cross-file symbols) and across a rename, signature change, move, impact
analysis, or "where is this / what uses this / change every caller". Use them for any code work, not only these cases.

**Locating code, or finding/changing every use of a symbol — get the line-accurate set in ONE navigation call, then act:**
1. `navigation search-signatures --pattern "<name>" --output fqns` — copy the EXACT method fqn(s); never hand-construct fqns. (Overloaded/same-named across types: keep all the fqns.)
2. `navigation trace-callers --fqn "<method-fqn>" --output edit-targets` — returns a flat list of `{file_path, line}` for the statically resolved call sites, including tests. For several fqns, pipe them: `… --output fqns | navigation trace-callers --fqn-stdin --output edit-targets`. In Python/JS/TS, where dynamic dispatch can hide call sites from `trace-callers`, use `navigation search-bodies --pattern "<call-site-regex>" --output edit-targets` instead (flat `{file_path, line}` list from full-text body matches, incl. tests). Because `search-bodies` is full-text regex, use a call-site-anchored pattern (e.g. `\\.processRequest\\(`) so you do not match partial names, variables, or comments.
3. Apply the edit at each `{file_path, line}` directly — the list is already line-accurate and complete for that query (see "Trust the output" below; do not re-search). To enumerate a type's implementors/subtypes (e.g. to thread a generic), use `get-type-hierarchy`; to find every file that references a type, use `get-references`.

- `navigation search-signatures --pattern "<regex>"` — find declarations (e.g. by name, annotations, modifiers)
- `navigation search-bodies --pattern "<regex>"` — find where an API/pattern is used in bodies
- `navigation get-source --fqn "<fqn>"` — read a symbol's source
- `navigation trace-callers --fqn "<fqn>"` — all callers ("what breaks if I change this?")
- `navigation trace-callees --fqn "<fqn>"` — execution flow ("what does this call?")
- `navigation get-type-hierarchy --fqn "<fqn>"` — class inheritance / interface implementations
- `navigation get-references --fqn "<fqn>"` — class/module-level coupling (which files reference this)

FQNs and results:
- FQNs are SYMBOL identifiers, not file paths — never pass a path like `src/foo.ts` to `get-references`/`trace-callers`; pass the symbol. For C#, generic-type FQNs contain backticks (e.g. `Registry`2`) and braces — ALWAYS single-quote the `--fqn` argument so the shell does not mangle it; address a C# property via its accessor FQN, not a `P:` form.
- In dynamically-typed languages (Python, JS/TS), `trace-callers`/`get-references` may miss call sites reached via dynamic dispatch or duck typing — for those, `search-bodies` is the full-text, all-occurrence-lines enumerator for a call-site regex.
- An empty nav result means no symbol of that KIND matched (or the fqn is wrong) — it is not a tool failure and does not mean the name is absent from the code; re-run `search-signatures --output fqns` or use ONE `search-bodies` query.

Trust the output (so you do not double-search):
- Treat nav results as authoritative and act on them directly — do NOT re-`grep` or re-`Read` a
  symbol nav already returned, and do NOT `grep` to find or confirm the line numbers an
  `--output edit-targets` list already gives you (it includes test call sites). If a specific result
  you expected is genuinely missing, fall back to ONE `navigation search-bodies --pattern "<call-site-regex>" --output edit-targets` query, not `grep`.
- The danger to AVOID is masking errors or auto-falling-back to grep: `… 2>/dev/null || grep …`
  swallows a wrong-fqn error and silently greps. For connection/permission errors, see the IMPORTANT
  block above. (Capturing large output to a file and filtering it with `jq` is encouraged — see Best Practices.)

### When Reviewing or Changing Architecture

Check architecture before introducing new modules or cross-module dependencies, and when reviewing module layout or auditing dependency direction.

- `architecture get-current` — actual module dependency graph (**Java, C#, JS/TS, Python**)
- `architecture get-intended` — allowed dependency rules (**Java, C#, JS/TS, Python**)

## Best Practices

- **Keep discovery output compact — it stays resident in context and re-costs every turn.**
  All navigation commands default to `--output compact` (one lean line per hit; per-command shapes
  are listed under "--output modes" below). Reach for `--output json` ONLY when you need the full
  nested call tree / hierarchy / inbound-outbound structure (and for the FEW symbols whose source you
  read, request `--fields signature` for declarations on search, or `navigation get-source --fields body`
  for full source) — never as the way you scan a result set, since a multi-K-char JSON dump is
  re-billed every turn. Use `--output edit-targets` for a rename.
- **For a large result, capture it to a file and read selectively — never carry the dump inline.**
  e.g. `navigation … --output json > /tmp/refs.json` then `jq`/read just the rows you need.
- **When applying edits across many files, delegate the bulk edits to a sub-agent (or feed the
  `--output edit-targets` list to one batch operation) — do NOT hand-edit dozens of sites yourself
  in the main context.** A sub-agent fans out in its own context and returns only the result,
  instead of keeping the resident context (search dumps, read files) live and re-billed every turn.
- Use `--limit 20` or less on `navigation search-signatures` / `navigation search-bodies` to bound result count and avoid exceeding context windows. (On `navigation trace-callers` / `navigation trace-callees`, `--limit` caps only the immediate callers/callees, not deeper `--depth` levels — see those commands' options.)
- Use `--depth 2` or `--depth 3` for `navigation trace-callers`, `navigation trace-callees`, and `architecture get-current`. For trace-callers/trace-callees, note `--limit` caps only the immediate level — deeper levels are uncapped — so start at `--depth 1` for hot, widely-called symbols and increase only as needed.
- Use `--fields` to reduce responses; valid names are per-command.
- Use `navigation search-signatures` (compact by default) to discover exact FQNs rather than
  constructing them manually.
- **Progressive disclosure**: start with `architecture` and `guidelines get` for the
  big picture, drill down with `navigation search-signatures`, `navigation trace-callers`, `navigation trace-callees`, and `navigation get-references`
  for specifics.

## Pipeline Composition

Commands can be piped together using `--output fqns` and `--fqn-stdin`:

```bash
# Find all repository classes, then get source code for each
sonar context navigation search-signatures --pattern ".*Repository" --output fqns \
  | sonar context navigation get-source --fqn-stdin

# Find service classes, then get each one's type hierarchy
sonar context navigation search-signatures --pattern ".*Service" --output fqns \
  | sonar context navigation get-type-hierarchy --fqn-stdin
```

**`--output` modes** (canonical; default is `compact` for ALL navigation commands): `compact` — one lean line per hit, shape per-command: `fqn<TAB>file_path:line` for search/trace, `in|out<TAB>fqn<TAB>file_path:line` for references, `fqn<TAB>file_path:line` for type-hierarchy; `json` — the full result (nested call tree / hierarchy / inbound-outbound structure); `fqns` — one FQN per line; `names` — short names; `edit-targets` (alias `locations`) — flat `{file_path, line}` list. Prefer compact/`fqns` for discovery; use `--output json --fields …` only for the full structure or the few symbols you read in full. (See Best Practices for the cost rationale.)

**`--fqn-stdin`**: reads FQNs from stdin, one per line. Mutually exclusive with
`--fqn`.

Use pipelines when you need information about multiple symbols discovered from a
search.

## Command Reference

### Troubleshooting Commands

Use these only when queries fail, the daemon appears unhealthy, or results seem stale.

#### `tool start` — Start the daemon

```bash
sonar context tool start
```

#### `tool status` — Show daemon status

```bash
sonar context tool status
sonar context tool status --project-key <key>
```

#### `tool stop` — Stop a daemon

Requires an explicit target (no bare `tool stop`): `--project-key <key>` (daemon for that project), `--cwd <path>` (daemon serving the given directory), `--pid <pid>` (daemon with that PID), `--all` (every daemon), or `--current` (daemon serving *this* shell's current working directory).

```bash
sonar context tool stop --project-key <key>
sonar context tool stop --all
sonar context tool stop --current   # daemon serving the current working directory (no path needed)
```

### Query Commands

Query commands auto-start the daemon when this workspace is already configured.
Auto-start does not create workspace configuration or Sonar authentication; if
setup is missing, follow the error recovery guidance below. Most commands output
JSON to stdout; `guidelines get` outputs markdown text.

#### `navigation search-signatures` — Find code by signature patterns

```bash
sonar context navigation search-signatures \
  --pattern ".*Repository" \
  --fields "fqn,file_path,start_line" \
  --limit 10
```

Regex search on function/method/class declarations. Use to find implementations
by signature features such as name, annotations, or modifiers.

Options:

- `--pattern <regex>` (required, repeatable) — regex to match in signatures. Multiple patterns are combined with OR.
- `--exclude-pattern <regex>` (repeatable) — regex to exclude
- `--include-glob <glob>` — include only files whose paths match the glob; quote the pattern to avoid shell expansion
- `--exclude-glob <glob>` — exclude files whose paths match the glob; quote the pattern to avoid shell expansion
- `--fields <fields>` — comma-separated fields to include. Valid fields:
  `fqn`, `file_path`, `item_type`, `signature`, `start_line`, `start_column`, `end_line`, `end_column`, `match_lines`.
  Both signature and body search default to `fqn,file_path,start_line,match_lines`
  when omitted (`match_lines` stays empty for signature search). Request
  `signature` explicitly when you need declaration code; use `navigation get-source --fields body`
  when you need full bodies.
  `match_lines` is requested by default for both search commands but is only ever
  populated by `search-bodies` (the lines where the pattern matched inside the body);
  for `search-signatures` it is empty and omitted from output.
- `--limit <n>` — max results (default: 10)
- `--output <compact|json|fqns|names|edit-targets>` — output mode (**default: `compact`** — one line per hit,
  `fqn<TAB>file_path:line`: the identifier to copy plus a read anchor; see "--output modes"). Use `fqns`
  for piping; `edit-targets` (alias `locations`) emits a flat `{file_path, line}` list from
  `match_lines`, falling back to each hit's declaration line when no matched lines are present.
  Request `--output json --fields signature` ONLY for the few declarations whose signature you need
  to inspect (use `navigation get-source --fields body` to read full source).

> `--fields` is per-command; use the field list under each command.

#### `navigation search-bodies` — Find code by body content patterns

```bash
sonar context navigation search-bodies \
  --pattern "TODO|FIXME" \
  --fields "fqn,file_path,start_line,match_lines,signature" \
  --limit 20
```

Same options and valid `--fields` as `navigation search-signatures`; searches inside function/method bodies.
For structured caller/usage analysis, prefer `navigation trace-callers` / `navigation trace-callees` (call chains) or
`navigation get-references` (class/module-level coupling). But in dynamically-typed languages (Python, JS/TS), where
those miss call sites reached via dynamic dispatch, use `navigation search-bodies` with a call-site-anchored regex
(e.g. `\.processRequest\(`) as the full-text fallback to enumerate every call site (see the navigation workflow above).

#### `navigation get-source` — Get source code for a symbol

```bash
sonar context navigation get-source --fqn "com.example.UserService#save" \
  --fields "signature,body,start_line,end_line,file_path"
```

Options:

- `--fqn <fqn>` (required) — fully qualified name
- `--fqn-stdin` — read FQNs from stdin (one per line). Mutually exclusive with `--fqn`.
- `--fields <fields>` — comma-separated fields to include. Valid fields:
  `signature`, `body`, `structure_type`, `start_line`, `start_column`, `end_line`, `end_column`, `file_path`.
  By default (no `--fields`) the response is a lean span — `signature`, `start_line`,
  `end_line`, `structure_type`, and `file_path` — and **omits** `body`; request `body`
  explicitly (e.g. `--fields "signature,body,start_line,end_line,file_path"`) to get
  the full source. Use `file_path` plus the line span as an anchor for a targeted read.

#### `navigation trace-callees` / `navigation trace-callers` — Trace call chains

```bash
sonar context navigation trace-callees \
  --fqn "com.example.UserService#save" \
  --fields "fqn,signature,calls" \
  --depth 2
```

Options:

- `--fqn <fqn>` (required) — fully qualified name
- `--fqn-stdin` — read FQNs from stdin (one per line). Mutually exclusive with `--fqn`.
- `--depth <n>` — call chain depth (default: 1)
- `--limit <n>` — cap immediate callers/callees only (default: 10); deeper `--depth` levels are not capped
- `--fields <fields>` — comma-separated fields to include. Valid fields:
  `direction`, `depth`, `fqn`, `file_path`, `signature`, `start_line`, `start_column`, `end_line`, `end_column`, `call_site_lines`, `calls`, `truncated`.
  Each node carries BOTH its declaration `start_line` AND `call_site_lines` (the
  line(s) where the edge to its parent is invoked) by default — no flag
  needed; use `--fields` to trim.
- `--output <compact|json|fqns|names|edit-targets>` — output mode (**default: `compact`**; see "--output modes"). For this command, the compact line prefers `call_site_lines`, falls back to `start_line`, and flattens across `--depth`; `--output json` gives the full nested call tree (the `calls` structure); `edit-targets` (alias `locations`) emits a flat, deduplicated `{file_path, line}` list for one-shot bulk renames.

> Class FQN (not a method): both commands ignore direction and return the same
> inbound/outbound architectural references as `navigation get-references`. Prefer
> `navigation get-references` for class-level coupling; use `trace-callers`/`trace-callees`
> only for method-level FQNs.

#### `navigation get-type-hierarchy` — Get type hierarchy for a class or struct

```bash
sonar context navigation get-type-hierarchy --fqn "com.example.BaseService" \
  --fields "fqn,parents,children"
```

Options:

- `--fqn <fqn>` (required) — fully qualified name
- `--fqn-stdin` — read FQNs from stdin (one per line). Mutually exclusive with `--fqn`.
- `--fields <fields>` — comma-separated fields to include. Valid fields:
  `fqn`, `file_path`, `start_line`, `depth`, `dependency_kind`, `parents`, `children`.
- `--output <compact|json|fqns|names|edit-targets>` — output mode (**default: `compact`** — one line
  per related type `fqn<TAB>file_path:line` (the type's declaration line), flattened across the
  parents/children tree). Request `--output json` for the full nested hierarchy structure. Use `fqns`
  for piping; `edit-targets` (alias `locations`) emits a flat `{file_path, line}` list of each type's declaration.

#### `navigation get-references` — Find references to a symbol

```bash
sonar context navigation get-references --fqn "com.example.UserService" \
  --fields "fqn,dependency_kinds"
```

Only accepts class/interface/module FQNs — not method FQNs. Use `navigation trace-callers` or `navigation trace-callees` for
method-level analysis.

Options:

- `--fqn <fqn>` (required) — fully qualified name
- `--fqn-stdin` — read FQNs from stdin (one per line). Mutually exclusive with `--fqn`.
- `--fields <fields>` — comma-separated fields to include. Valid fields:
  `fqn`, `file_path`, `match_lines`, `dependency_kinds`.
  `match_lines` is every occurrence line for the referrer (sorted, deduplicated, null
  when the underlying edge carries no location) so a referrer that uses the symbol on many
  lines needs no re-grep. It has no column field.
- `--output <compact|json|fqns|names|edit-targets>` — output mode (**default: `compact`**; see "--output modes"). For this command the `in`/`out` marker tags inbound vs outbound and the compact `line` is the first-occurrence anchor; `--output json` gives the full inbound/outbound structure with `match_lines`/`dependency_kinds`. Use `fqns` for piping; `edit-targets` (alias `locations`) covers all referrers and all affected lines for one-shot bulk renames.

#### `architecture get-current` / `architecture get-intended` — View module architecture (Java, C#, JS/TS, Python)

```bash
sonar context architecture get-current --ecosystem java
sonar context architecture get-intended
```

Options:

- `get-current`: `--ecosystem <java|cs|py|js|ts>`, `--depth <n>`, `--path-prefix <prefix>`, `--fields <fields>`, `--format <compact|pretty>`
- `get-intended`: `--fields <fields>`, `--format <compact|pretty>`

> `architecture get-current` defaults to `--depth 3`. `--depth` counts from the
> absolute root, not from `--path-prefix`, so raise it when drilling into a deep
> prefix. `is_leaf` reflects the full graph, not the depth-truncated view. Start
> with `--depth 0` (no path prefix) for a root overview, then use a root FQN as
> `--path-prefix` with higher depth to drill in. FQNs may use different separators
> (`:`, `.`, `/`) depending on language — always check `--depth 0` output first.
> `architecture get-intended` is not scoped by ecosystem, depth, or path prefix;
> those are current-view options and fail fast if passed.

#### `guidelines get` — Get coding guidelines and issues (All Languages)

```bash
# Space-separated values after a single flag (preferred for multiple values):
sonar context guidelines get --categories "Auth & Identity" "Exception & Error Handling" --languages java
# Repeated flags also work:
sonar context guidelines get --categories "Auth & Identity" --categories "Exception & Error Handling" --languages java
sonar context guidelines get --languages java --files "src/main/java/com/example/Service.java"
```

Output is **markdown text**, not JSON — print it directly rather than parsing as JSON.

Options:

- `--categories <value> [<value>...]` — categories to retrieve. Requires `--languages`.
  Pass multiple values space-separated (`--categories "A" "B"`) or repeat the flag
  (`--categories "A" --categories "B"`). Both forms are equivalent.
  Available: "Auth & Identity", "Exception & Error Handling", "Testing Practices",
  "Web Security (Injection/XSS)", "Secrets & Cryptography", "Cloud & Network Security",
  "Logging & Monitoring", "Memory & Resource Safety", "Async & Concurrency",
  "Naming & Code Style", "Complexity & Maintainability", "Language Idioms & Modernization",
  "Type Systems & Logic Safety", "Architectural Integrity", "Web Service & API Design",
  "Data Modeling & Persistence", "Data Querying & Performance",
  "Framework Configuration & DI", "Serialization & Message Formats",
  "Inline Documentation & Metadata", "Environment & Build Configuration",
  "Regular Expressions", "Data Science & Big Data", "UI & Accessibility",
  "Mobile & Hardware SDKs", "Platform Governance", "i18n & Localization".
- `--languages <value> [<value>...]` — target languages (java, typescript, python, etc.). Required when `--categories` is used.
  Pass multiple values space-separated (`--languages java python`) or repeat the flag.
- `--mode <mode>` — retrieval mode: `project_based`, `category_based`, or `combined`.
  Default is `project_based`, but switches to `category_based` automatically when `--categories` is provided.
- `--files <value> [<value>...]` — file paths to filter by. Space-separated or repeated flag.

#### `dependencies check` — Check a dependency for vulnerabilities, malware, and license compliance (All Ecosystems)

```bash
sonar context dependencies check --purl "pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.21"
sonar context dependencies check --purl "pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.14.1"
```

**MUST run before adding or updating any dependency.** See the "Before Adding or
Updating Dependencies" workflow above for how to react to each field.

Options:

- `--purl <purl>` (required) — Package URL with version
- `--format <compact|pretty>` — output format (default: compact)

Returns:

```text
{purl, vulnerabilities: [{id, cvssScore, cweIds, riskSeverity, withdrawn, publishedOn,
  fixedVersions: [{version, fixLevel, descriptionCode}], unaffectedVersions}],
  malicious, license: {expression, allowed}}
```

## Output Interpretation

- **Stdout**: Result data. JSON for most commands; markdown text for `guidelines get`.
- **Stderr**: Progress messages, warnings. Informational only.
- **Exit code 0**: Success.
- **Exit code 1**: User-fixable error. Check the `error:` and `hint:` lines on stderr.
- **Exit code 2**: Daemon or tool error. The daemon may need a restart.

Error recovery:

| Error                | Exit | Recovery                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token_missing`      | 1    | Ask user to check the status of `sonar auth` to ensure that authentication has been configured properly |
| `daemon_not_found`   | 1    | Auto-start does not create workspace configuration. Check `sonar context tool status` to see whether another workspace or project is configured; if this workspace should be integrated, surface the problem to the user and advise them to rerun the sonar context integration process |
| `config_not_found`   | 1    | Auto-start does not create workspace configuration. This workspace is not configured for Context Augmentation. Surface the problem to the user including any relevant details and advise them to rerun the sonar context integration process |
| `invalid_args`       | 1    | Check flags and retry                                             |
| `auth_failed`        | 1    | Ask user to verify their SonarQube token                          |
| `daemon_unreachable` | 2    | Run `sonar context tool stop --all` then retry (auto-restarts)   |
| `daemon_start_failed`| 2    | Check `sonar context tool status`, inspect daemon logs, then retry with `sonar context tool start` |
| `tool_error`         | 2    | Check error message — usually invalid FQN or missing data         |
| `data_loading`       | 2    | Wait a few seconds and retry — daemon is still loading data       |

If results seem stale: the daemon auto-refreshes on branch changes and new
analyses, and restarts automatically after idle timeout (30 min default).
